### About Buy-A-Mon:

My team and I worked together over the course of a week to build this mock e-commerce website from scratch. 

My main focus was on the back-end database structure, I designed the Schema for the Order and Order-Items tables.
I also wrote the Express routes to call the database and serve up users' carts via those tables. 
Lastly, I helped implement authorization middleware in out Express routes to prevent our database from being manipulated by outside forces. 

On the front-end I wrote the React components to edit a user's cart.
I wrote the functionallity for non-logged-in users to have a persistant "Guest Cart" utilizing local storage.
